# Core NLP library for the initial SpacyHandler
spacy>=3.0.0,<4.0.0

# scispaCy is not a direct pip install for all models,
# models are often installed via URL.
# Add a note here for users if they want to use scispaCy models.
# e.g. # pip install https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/v0.5.3/en_core_sci_sm-0.5.3.tar.gz

# Other libraries for NER tools (MedCAT, Spark NLP, Flair/HunFlair, etc.)
# should be installed by the user if they intend to fully implement and use those handlers.
# Example:
# medcat>=1.0.0
# spark-nlp>=5.0.0 (Note: Spark NLP for Healthcare has specific licensing)
# flair>=0.12.0
# fds.medner (if available on PyPI, or link to source)

# Add any other general utility if we find one later, but for now this is minimal.
