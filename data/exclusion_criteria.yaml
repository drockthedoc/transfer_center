  overview:
    - "On-site pediatric hospitalist and PICU attending available for admission/consultation of patients 24/7[cite: 1]."
    - "The clinical team will determine if the special needs of the patient can be addressed at the community sites[cite: 2]."
    - "Decisions are made based on the skill set of the clinical team, availability of consultants, and specialty care[cite: 3]."
    - "The Clinical Team is defined as: Physician responsible for care, RN responsible for care, Physician receiving the patient, and NAC equivalent[cite: 10]."
    - "These are general recommendations and should not replace discussion amongst the teams[cite: 7]."
    - "Particular attention should be paid to the far-right column in the source tables, which includes exclusions for all Community sites (West and The Woodlands Campuses)[cite: 8]."
  campus_capacities:
    west_campus: "Acute Care includes 42 beds (24 on 3W + 18 on 5W) + 4 overflow beds on 4W. PICU includes 22 beds[cite: 4]."
    the_woodlands_campus: "Acute Care includes 46 beds (3rd, 5th Floors). PICU includes 14 beds (4th Floor)[cite: 5]. NICU includes 14 beds (4th Floor)[cite: 6]."
  specific_notes_applicable_to_both:
    cardiology_sop_reference: "Refer to Appendix A (Cardiology SOP Document) for guidelines to admit cardiac patients for in-patient monitoring[cite: 34]. ALL patients should be discussed with the cardiologist-on-call[cite: 34]."
    trauma_guidelines:
      - "Certain trauma patients involving only one organ system (e.g., fracture) or trauma with mild complications (e.g., dog bite with infection), may be admitted to Acute Care at Community Sites to the appropriate surgical service[cite: 31]."
      - "All non-accidental trauma (NAT) patients, including those medically cleared and pending CPS disposition, as well as all head trauma with complications (including concussive symptoms) should be transferred to the appropriate surgical service at the Medical Center Campus[cite: 32]."
      - "For full trauma exclusions and algorithms, see the TCH Trauma Services SharePoint[cite: 30, 31]."
