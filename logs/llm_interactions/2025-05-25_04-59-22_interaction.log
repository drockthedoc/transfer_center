Key is campus_id or name.\n      \"OtherCampusID1\": \"Reason why OtherCampusID1 was not chosen...\",\n      \"OtherCampusName2\": \"Reason why OtherCampusName2 was not chosen...\"\n    },\n    \"key_factors_considered\": [string], // List of key factors, e.g., [\"distance\", \"specialty_match\", \"bed_availability_heuristic\"]\n    \"confidence_explanation\": string    // Optional: Brief explanation of the confidence score\n  },\n  \"notes\": [string],                  // Optional: Any additional notes or brief details\n  \"transport_details\": {              // Details about transport for the UI\n    \"mode\": string,                   // Suggested transport mode (e.g., \"GROUND_AMBULANCE\", \"HELICOPTER\")\n    \"estimated_time_minutes\": number, // Estimated transport time in minutes\n    \"special_requirements\": string    // Any special transport requirements (e.g., \"Requires NICU-capable team\")\n  },\n  \"conditions\": {                     // Current conditions affecting transport for the UI\n    \"weather\": string,                // Brief weather summary (e.g., \"Clear, 75F\")\n    \"traffic\": string                 // Brief traffic summary (e.g., \"Light traffic on I-10\")\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Instructions for Explainability Details:**\n- `main_recommendation_reason`: Clearly state why the *recommended_campus_id* is the best choice.\n- `alternative_reasons`: If other campuses were strong contenders but ultimately not chosen, briefly explain why for each. Use their ID or name as the key.\n- `key_factors_considered`: List the critical factors that influenced the decision (e.g., specific patient need, unique hospital capability, distance, bed availability).\n- `confidence_explanation`: Briefly explain why the confidence score is what it is (e.g., \"High confidence due to clear specialty match and bed availability\" or \"Moderate confidence due to conflicting factors\").\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Only return a valid JSON object.\n"
